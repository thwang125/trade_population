            This study explores how population size affects a country's level of trade dependency. Using data from 211 countries in 2023 obtained from the World Bank, we investigate whether smaller economies tend to be more dependent on international trade than larger ones. The analysis measures trade dependency as the ratio of exports and imports to GDP. The results show a clear negative relationship between population size and trade openness: countries with smaller populations, such as Luxembourg and Singapore, exhibit significantly higher trade dependence, while large economies like the United States or China are relatively self-sufficient. These findings suggest that domestic market size plays a crucial role in shaping a nation's reliance on global trade and provide empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that smaller economies are inherently more trade-dependent rather than gaining money within their own countries.

      <h4 class="title is-4">What is Trade Dependency?</h4>
      <p>
        Trade dependence is the extent to which a country's economy relies on international trade for its growth and stability, often indicated by the share of trade in national income. There are several methods for determining the level of trade dependency. The most common method is the ratio (%) of trade to GDP. This ratio illustrates the relative importance of international trade in the economy of a country.

      <p>
        The dataset for this analysis was obtained from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. We utilized data from 2023 covering 211 countries. The key variables used in this study are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Population:</strong> Total population of the country (Log-transformed for analysis).</li>
        <li><strong>Trade (% of GDP):</strong> The sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of gross domestic product.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To analyze the relationship, we performed a regression analysis using the log10 of population size as the independent variable and the Trade-to-GDP ratio as the dependent variable.

    <div class="content has-text-justified">

        The scatter plot above illustrates the trade ratio on a linear scale starting from 0%. The red dotted regression line is $y = -26.79 * \log_{10}(x) + 279.54$. This regression line shows a negative correlation trend, indicating that countries with larger populations tend to have a lower trade-to-GDP ratio. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The $R^2$ (coefficient of determination) value is <strong>0.167</strong>, meaning that population (log value) explains approximately 16.7% of the variation in a country's trade dependence. While this value suggests that other factors also play a significant role, the negative trend is statistically observable.

        Further analysis supports the initial findings. Countries with smaller populations, such as Luxembourg and Singapore, exhibit significantly higher trade dependence. In contrast, large economies like the United States or China are relatively self-sufficient, relying more on their internal markets. This suggests that domestic market size is a key determinant of how much a nation relies on the global market.

      <p>
        As can be seen from the graph in the results, population and trade dependency have a negative relationship. This result is presumed because a larger population enables a country to sustain itself with less trade by using its large domestic market.
      </p>
      <p>
        The R-squared value between the two factors is 0.167. Although this value may seem low, in social science research, this level of R-squared value can show a meaningful relationship. This study confirms the negative relationship between population size and trade dependency, which allows one to predict how much a country's economic performance is influenced by trade, by the size of its population.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, this implies that there is another factor involved in deciding the trade dependency. Future research could investigate what these other factors are and why population and trade dependency have a negative relationship.
